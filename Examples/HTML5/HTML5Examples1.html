<h1>HTML Videos</h1>

<!--
	These two examples show how to include a video in html4 and html5.

-->


HTML5
<!-- HTML5 way -->
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="includes/pirateCat.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<br />
Old Way
<!-- Old way. Try this with different browsers. If you don't have the proper codecs, you won't be able to vide the video. You could also use Javascript to show the video, but that could get messy.-->
<embed src="includes/pirateCat.mp4"/>

</body>
